- Price chart visualization components  
- Investment performance analysis  
- Algorithmic trading strategy testing  

#### Market Metrics Integration  
Combined with volume and liquidity data, these APIs enable:  
- Market sentiment analysis tools  
- Automated arbitrage opportunities  
- Risk management dashboards  

**FAQ: How frequently is price data updated?**  
Real-time endpoints refresh every 15 seconds, while historical data updates hourly with 7-year retention.  

## Token Project Information  

### Comprehensive Token Profiles  
The `/token-detail` API returns structured data including:  
- Project whitepaper links  
- Smart contract addresses  
- Circulating supply metrics  
- Development activity statistics
