# Send, Receive, and Swap Crypto: A Comprehensive Guide  

Cryptocurrency transactions have become increasingly accessible through platforms like Robinhood Wallet, enabling users to send, receive, buy, transfer, and swap digital assets seamlessly. This guide explores the functionalities of Robinhood Wallet for crypto transactions, focusing on best practices, network compatibility, fees, and security considerations.  

## Sending Cryptocurrency  

Robinhood Wallet allows users to send crypto to any address or exchange supporting Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Dogecoin, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, or Base. To ensure successful transfers:  
1. **Verify Network Compatibility**: Always confirm the recipient's platform supports the same network. For example, sending Polygon-based tokens requires the recipient to accept Polygon.  
2. **Double-Check Addresses**: Enter recipient addresses carefully or scan QR codes to avoid irreversible errors.  

### Step-by-Step Process (Mobile):  
1. Open Robinhood Wallet â†’ Tap **Home** â†’ **Send**  
2. Select the cryptocurrency to send  
3. Scan the recipientâ€™s QR code or manually enter their wallet address  
4. Specify the amount  
5. Review transaction details â†’ Confirm with biometrics, Face ID, or PIN

## Receiving Cryptocurrency  

Receiving crypto is equally straightforward, provided the sender uses compatible networks (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.).  

### Steps to Receive:  
1. Navigate to **Home** â†’ **Receive**  
2. Choose the desired cryptocurrency  
3. Share your QR code or copy the wallet address for the sender to use  

Ensure exchanges or wallets sending funds support withdrawals on the specified network. For instance, receiving Ethereum-based tokens requires the sender to use the Ethereum network.  

### Security Reminder:  
- Verify the senderâ€™s identity before accepting funds.  
- Monitor transaction confirmations to prevent double-spending risks.  

## Buying and Transferring Crypto  

Robinhood Wallet integrates with third-party services like Robinhood Connect and Sardine for purchasing crypto directly.  

### Robinhood Connect  
**Supported Payment Methods**: Debit card, bank account, or Robinhood buying power.  

**Steps**:  
1. Open **Buy** section â†’ Select crypto/network  
2. Log in via the Robinhood app or web browser  
3. Choose payment method â†’ Review and submit order  

### Sardine  
**Supported Payment Methods**: Debit or credit card (availability-dependent).  

**Process**:  
1. Initiate purchase in Robinhood Wallet â†’ Redirect to Sardine  
2. Complete transaction â†’ Return to Robinhood Wallet  

### Transferring from Robinhood Crypto  
Move assets from your Robinhood Crypto account to your self-custody wallet:  
1. Select **Transfer from Robinhood** â†’ Choose crypto/network  
2. Enter amount â†’ Confirm with 2FA code  

## Swapping Crypto  

Robinhood Wallet partners with decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators like 0x API and LI.FI to facilitate swaps across Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism networks.  

### How to Swap:  
1. Go to **Swap** â†’ Select "from" and "to" tokens/networks  
2. Enter amount â†’ Review â†’ Confirm transaction  

### Key Concepts:  
- **Guaranteed Rates**: Locked for 30 seconds, routed through market makers.  
- **Estimated Rates**: Continuously updated, executed via AMMs if within slippage tolerance.  

### Token Approvals  
First-time swaps require approving tokens for DEX aggregators, enhancing security by controlling unauthorized access.  

## Cross-Chain Swaps  

Cross-chain swaps enable transferring assets between networks (e.g., Ethereum to Polygon).  

### Steps:  
1. Choose source and destination networks in the **Swap** section  
2. Confirm transaction details â†’ Swipe to complete  

### Risks and Considerations:  
- **Transaction Time**: Cross-chain swaps take longer due to bridge mechanisms.  
- **Liquidity Risks**: Insufficient liquidity on the destination network may cause failures.

## Fees, Timing, and Liquidity  

Understanding fee structures is crucial for cost-effective transactions:  

| Fee Type                | Description                                                                 |  
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Network Fees (Gas)**  | Blockchain transaction costs; fluctuate with network congestion.            |  
| **Robinhood Swap Fees** | 0.80% (same-chain), 0.73% (cross-chain)                                     |  
| **DEX Provider Fees**   | 0x: 0.05% | LI.FI: 0.05% (same), 0.12% (cross)                              |  
| **Bridge Fees**         | Third-party costs for cross-network transfers.                              |  

### Timing Variables:  
- Same-chain swaps: Near-instantaneous.  
- Cross-chain swaps: Minutes to hours, depending on bridge efficiency.  

### Limited Liquidity  
Bridging assets doesnâ€™t guarantee liquidity for activities like lending. Always verify token support on the destination network.  

## Security Best Practices  

1. **Network Compatibility**: Ensure sender/receiver use the same blockchain.  
2. **Address Verification**: Confirm wallet addresses before executing transactions.  
3. **Scam Awareness**: Avoid interacting with unsolicited links or unknown senders.  
4. **Token Approvals**: Regularly audit approved tokens in your wallet settings.
