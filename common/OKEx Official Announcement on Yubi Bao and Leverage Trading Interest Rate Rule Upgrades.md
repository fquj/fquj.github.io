## Core Upgrade Components

The upgrade introduces three fundamental changes to the platform's interest rate framework:

1. **Interest Rate Determination Model**
   - Legacy system: Fixed rates based on deposit/borrowing ratio
   - New system: Real-time market auction model

2. **Lending Capacity Expansion**
   - Yubi Bao deposit limits increased 10x
   - Leverage trading borrowing limits doubled by tier

3. **Interest Payment Mechanism**
   - Transition to hourly settlement cycles
   - Uniform rate application for all users

## Operational Transition Timeline

The upgrade follows a structured two-phase implementation:

### 1. Preparatory Phase (Dec 2, 2021 23:00 - Dec 6, 2021 00:00 HKT)
- **System Maintenance**: 23:00-03:00 HKT (Dec 2)
- **Simulated Auction**: Automatic participation at optimal rates
- **Interest Distribution Shift**: Hourly payments starting Dec 3
- **Rate Adjustment Window**: Users modify rates before final implementation

### 2. Live Auction Phase (Dec 6, 2021 00:00 HKT onwards)
- **Market Matching Engine**: Hourly competitive bidding
- **Lending Success Criteria**:
  - Rates below market = Full allocation
  - Rates equal = Pro-rata allocation
  - Rates above = No allocation

## Market Auction Mechanics

The upgraded system operates through a transparent price discovery process:

1. **Hourly Auction Cycle**
   - Begins at each hour's start
   - Processes all active lending offers
   - Matches against current borrowing demand

2. **Rate Determination Process**
   - Sorts offers from lowest to highest rate
   - Accumulates lending capacity until demand met
   - Final matched rate becomes market rate

3. **Allocation Outcomes**
   - Tier 1: Rates < Market Rate â†’ Full allocation
   - Tier 2: Rates = Market Rate â†’ Pro-rata allocation
   - Tier 3: Rates > Market Rate â†’ No allocation

## Illustrative Case Study

Consider this BTC lending scenario with 200 BTC market demand:

| User | Offer Quantity | Offer Rate | Allocation Status | Earnings |
|------|----------------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| A    | 100 BTC        | 10%        | Fully Allocated   | 20% ROI  |
| B    | 200 BTC        | 20%        | 50% Allocated     | 20% ROI  |
| C    | 100 BTC        | 30%        | Rejected          | 0% ROI   |

In this example, User A's lower rate guarantees full allocation, User B's matching rate receives partial allocation based on time priority, and User C's higher rate fails to secure lending opportunities.

## Strategic Advantages for Users

### For Lenders (Yubi Bao Users)
- **Enhanced Earnings Potential**: 10x increased deposit limits
- **Market Responsiveness**: Dynamic rate adjustments
- **Predictable Returns**: Hourly interest payouts

### For Borrowers (Leverage Traders)
- **Standardized Rates**: Eliminated tier-based disparities
- **Increased Capacity**: 2x higher borrowing limits
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear market-driven rates

## Risk Management Framework

The upgraded system incorporates multiple safeguards:
1. **Gradual Limit Expansion**: Phased increase based on market conditions
2. **Emergency Protocols**: System administrator intervention rights
3. **Liquidity Monitoring**: Real-time market health assessments

## FAQ: Market-Driven Interest Rate System

**Q: What triggers the hourly interest rate determination?**  
A: The system automatically initiates rate determination at the start of each hour, matching available liquidity against current borrowing demand.

**Q: How are partial allocations handled during high demand?**  
A: When multiple lenders match the market rate, allocation follows time priority â€“ earlier submissions receive priority processing.

**Q: What happens to unallocated funds?**  
A: Unallocated deposits automatically re-enter the next hourly auction cycle, maintaining continuous earning potential.

**Q: Can I modify my rate after the auction begins?**  
A: Rate adjustments must be completed before the auction cycle begins â€“ changes during active auctions are not permitted.

**Q: How does the system handle extreme market volatility?**  
A: OKEx's risk management team maintains intervention rights to implement emergency measures when necessary.
