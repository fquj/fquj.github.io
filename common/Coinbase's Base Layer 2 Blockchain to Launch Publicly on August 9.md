# Coinbase's Base Layer 2 Blockchain to Launch Publicly on August 9  

Coinbase, the largest publicly traded U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, has announced the public launch of **Base**, its Layer 2 blockchain built using Optimism's OP Stack. The network will open to users on **August 9**, following a developer-focused test phase that began in July. This marks a significant step in Coinbaseâ€™s strategy to expand Ethereumâ€™s scalability and onboard mainstream users to decentralized applications (dApps).

## Launch Timeline and User Onboarding  

Starting **Thursday, users can bridge Ethereum (ETH)** to Base, preparing their wallets for the official mainnet launch. This phased rollout allows users to familiarize themselves with the network while ensuring system stability.  

> "Our mission has been clear: bring the next billion users and million builders on chain," said Jesse Pollak, creator of Base and head of protocols at Coinbase.  

The public launch coincides with Coinbaseâ€™s **Onchain Summer** initiative, a series of events encouraging developers and creators to build and engage with Base. Partners like Coca-Cola, Atari, and OpenSea are participating, signaling broad industry interest.

## Technical Foundations: Optimismâ€™s OP Stack  

Base leverages **Optimismâ€™s OP Stack**, an open-source framework for building Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. This technology enables faster and cheaper transactions by processing them off-chain while inheriting Ethereumâ€™s security. Key advantages include:  
- **Scalability**: Reduces congestion on the Ethereum mainnet.  
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Lowers gas fees for users and developers.  
- **Interoperability**: Supports seamless asset transfers between Ethereum and Base.  

Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is also utilizing the OP Stack for its upcoming rollup client, **Magi**, highlighting the frameworkâ€™s growing adoption.

## Early Adoption and Network Activity  

Despite not being fully live, Base has already attracted **over $68 million in ETH** from users, according to blockchain analytics platform Dune. This early traction underscores market confidence in Coinbaseâ€™s infrastructure.  

Coinbase Wallet, the exchangeâ€™s self-custodial solution, has simplified the bridging process. Users can already fund ETH on Base ahead of the launch, as confirmed by Coinbaseâ€™s official Twitter account:  

> "Fund your wallet on Base. Itâ€™s now possible to bridge or fund ETH on Base, which Coinbase Wallet makes simple."

## Onchain Summer: Driving Developer Engagement  

Coinbaseâ€™s **Onchain Summer** campaign aims to catalyze ecosystem growth by incentivizing creators to build on Base. Activities include:  
- **NFT Art Creation**: Collaborations with Coca-Cola and Atari.  
- **dApp Development**: Tools and grants for startups.  
- **Commemorative NFTs**: Users can mint exclusive digital collectibles.  

This initiative aligns with Coinbaseâ€™s vision of making blockchain technology accessible to mainstream audiences.

## Market Implications and Competitive Landscape  

The launch of Base positions Coinbase as a key player in Ethereumâ€™s Layer 2 ecosystem, competing with established solutions like **Arbitrum** and **Optimism**. By integrating OP Stack, Coinbase benefits from:  
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Shared infrastructure reduces development risks.  
- **Ecosystem Synergies**: Compatibility with existing Ethereum dApps.  

However, Baseâ€™s success will depend on user adoption, transaction volume, and partnerships. The $68 million in pre-launch ETH deposits suggests strong initial interest, but sustained growth requires continuous innovation.
