## Understanding the MiCA Regulatory Framework  

The MiCA framework, formally adopted by the European Parliament in 2023, represents the EU‚Äôs first comprehensive regulatory structure for digital assets. Key provisions include:  

| Regulatory Focus | MiCA Requirements |  
|-------------------|-------------------|  
| Stablecoins       | Reserves transparency and issuance limits |  
| Crypto Wallets    | Mandatory licensing for custodial services |  
| Crypto Exchanges  | Transaction monitoring and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance |  
| Digital Asset Issuers | Disclosure requirements for token sales |  

This standardized framework eliminates regulatory fragmentation across EU member states, reducing compliance costs for crypto businesses while enhancing consumer protections.
