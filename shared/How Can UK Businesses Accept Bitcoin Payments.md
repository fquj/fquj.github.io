# How Can UK Businesses Accept Bitcoin Payments?

## Understanding Bitcoin's Legal Status in the UK

Bitcoin operates in a regulatory gray area within the United Kingdom. While no specific legislation governs its use, the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) classifies cryptocurrencies as **digital assets** rather than legal tender. This classification impacts tax obligations for businesses and individuals engaging in crypto transactions.

**Key Regulatory Bodies Involved:**
- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA):** Oversees cryptocurrency exchange registration requirements
- **HMRC:** Provides tax guidance for crypto asset transactions
- **Bank of England:** Monitors potential systemic risks from crypto adoption

For businesses considering cryptocurrency payments, understanding these regulatory frameworks is crucial for compliance. Companies must register with the FCA if operating as a crypto exchange or wallet provider, requiring:
- Establishment of a legal entity
- UK registered office address
- Corporate bank account
- Tax registration

### 1. Payment Processor Selection
