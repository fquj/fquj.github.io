## Understanding NFTs: The Power of Digital Uniqueness  

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have redefined digital ownership through their **non-interchangeable** nature. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where each unit holds identical value, NFTs represent **one-of-a-kind digital assets** authenticated via blockchain. This innovation enables verifiable scarcity, making NFTs ideal for representing art, collectibles, and virtual real estate.  

### Key Characteristics of NFTs  
- **Immutable Ownership**: Blockchain records ensure transparent tracking of provenance.  
- **Programmable Royalties**: Creators earn perpetual royalties from secondary sales.  
- **Cross-Platform Utility**: NFTs can integrate with metaverse environments and gaming ecosystems.  

**FAQ 1: Can NFTs represent physical assets?**  
Yes! NFTs now tokenize real-world items like luxury goods and real estate through digital certificates of ownership.
