## What Are BTC, ETH, and USDT?

### Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It operates on a peer-to-peer network using blockchain technology, enabling secure, transparent transactions without intermediaries. BTC has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset often compared to digital gold.

### Ethereum (ETH)
Ethereum, launched in 2015, is a blockchain platform that introduced smart contractsâ€”self-executing agreements coded into the blockchain. ETH is its native cryptocurrency, used to pay transaction fees and interact with decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum's versatility has made it the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi).

### Tether (USDT)
Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, designed to maintain price stability. Unlike BTC or ETH, USDT's value doesn't fluctuate, making it a popular choice for traders seeking to avoid crypto market volatility. It operates on multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and Tron.

## BTC, USDT, ETH, BCH, and LTC Explained

### Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Bitcoin Cash emerged in 2017 as a Bitcoin fork aiming to improve scalability by increasing block sizes. This allows faster transactions at lower fees, making BCH more suitable for daily transactions compared to BTC.
