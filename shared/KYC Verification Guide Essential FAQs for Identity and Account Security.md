## What Is KYC Verification?  
KYC verification is a regulatory requirement that confirms user identities to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. Platforms like **OKX** use this process to:  
- Validate personal information (e.g., name, date of birth)  
- Confirm residence details  
- Assess financial history through documents like bank statements or tax returns  

This verification ensures compliance with global regulations and protects both users and platforms from illicit activities.  

### Why Is KYC Important?  
1. **Security**: Reduces risks of identity theft and unauthorized account access.  
2. **Compliance**: Meets legal requirements in regions like the European Economic Area (EEA).  
3. **Account Privileges**: Higher verification levels often unlock advanced features, such as higher transaction limits.

## Common Issues During Verification  
Even with proper documentation, verification can fail. Common reasons include:  
- **Blurred or low-quality images**: Submit clear scans without glare or shadows.  
- **Expired documents**: All materials must be current.  
- **Mismatched information**: Names, dates, and addresses must match across documents.  
- **Poor lighting in selfies**: Ensure your face is fully visible and unobstructed.  

### How to Avoid Failed Verifications  
1. Use a neutral background for ID and selfie photos.  
2. Avoid glare on documents by scanning in natural light.  
3. Double-check all personal details before submission.
