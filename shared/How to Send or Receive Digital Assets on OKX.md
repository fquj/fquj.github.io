# How to Send or Receive Digital Assets on OKX  

Managing digital assets on OKX involves two core actions: sending and receiving cryptocurrencies securely. Whether transferring funds to friends, external wallets, or exchanges, understanding the correct procedures ensures safety and efficiency. This guide breaks down the steps for both **internal transfers** and **blockchain transactions**, while emphasizing critical network compatibility requirements.

## Sending Digital Assets  

### 1. Sending to Friends (Internal Transfers)  
Internal transfers on OKX allow users to send assets directly to another OKX account using an email, phone number, or username. This method is ideal for quick, secure exchanges within the platform.  

**Steps:**  
1. Open the OKX app and navigate to the "Transfer" section.  
2. Select **Send > Send to Friends**.  
3. Choose the cryptocurrency and enter the recipientâ€™s **email, phone number, or username**.  
4. Input the amount and complete verification via **email and SMS codes**.  

**Important Note:**  
If the recipient doesnâ€™t have an active OKX account, the funds will automatically revert to the senderâ€™s wallet within **24 hours**.

### 2. Sending via Blockchain Address (On-Chain Transfers)  
For transfers to external wallets or exchanges, use the blockchain address method. This requires specifying the correct network to avoid irreversible losses.  

**Steps:**  
1. Go to **Transfer > Send via Address**.  
2. Select the cryptocurrency and input the recipientâ€™s **wallet address**.  
3. Choose the appropriate **network protocol** (e.g., USDT-TRC20 vs. USDT-ERC20).  
4. Confirm the transaction with verification codes.  

**Critical Considerations:**  
- **Network Compatibility:** Sending assets to an incompatible network (e.g., TRC20 to an ERC20 wallet) may result in permanent loss.  
- **Transaction Fees:** Gas fees vary depending on network congestion and blockchain protocol.

## Receiving Digital Assets  

Receiving crypto on OKX requires generating a deposit address and ensuring network alignment with the senderâ€™s platform.  

**Steps:**  
1. Open the OKX app and select **Receive**.  
2. Choose the cryptocurrency and the desired **network** (e.g., BTC, ETH, USDT-TRC20).  
3. Copy the deposit address and share it with the sender.  
4. On the senderâ€™s platform, initiate a withdrawal using the copied address and match the network.  

**Key Requirements:**  
- **Memo/Tag for Specific Assets:** For currencies like **XRP** or **XMR**, a **destination tag** or **payment ID** is mandatory. Omitting this detail may lead to lost funds.  
- **Network Matching:** Sending USDT via **ERC20** to an OKX wallet expecting **TRC20** will result in a failed transaction.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  

### Q1: What happens if I send crypto to the wrong network?  
A: Funds sent to an incompatible network are typically unrecoverable. Always double-check the recipientâ€™s network settings before confirming transactions.  

### Q2: How long does a blockchain transfer take?  
A: Transaction times vary:  
- **Bitcoin (BTC):** 10â€“30 minutes.  
- **Ethereum-based tokens (ERC20):** 1â€“5 minutes.  
- **TRC20 (USDT):** <1 minute.  

### Q3: Can I cancel a blockchain transaction after sending?  
A: No. Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Use internal transfers for cancellable options.  

### Q4: Why do some assets require a memo/tag?  
A: Memo/tags help identify transactions on networks like **Ripple (XRP)** or **Monero (XMR)**. Failing to include them may cause delays or fund loss.

## Best Practices for Secure Transactions  

| **Action**                | **Recommendation**                                                                 |  
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Double-Check Addresses** | Use copy-paste to avoid typos. Verify with a trusted third party if uncertain.    |  
| **Network Selection**      | Match the senderâ€™s and receiverâ€™s networks exactly (e.g., USDT-TRC20 vs. USDT-ERC20). |  
| **Test Transactions**      | Send a small amount first when using a new wallet or exchange.                    |  
| **Security Measures**      | Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and monitor transaction history regularly. |

## Case Study: Avoiding Common Pitfalls  

**Scenario:** Alice sent $500 worth of USDT to her OKX wallet but used **ERC20** instead of **TRC20**.  
**Outcome:** The funds never arrived.  
**Lesson:** Always confirm network compatibility with the recipientâ€™s wallet.

## Expanding Your Crypto Knowledge  

Understanding blockchain mechanics is crucial for safe asset management. For example:  
- **Gas Fees:** Ethereum transactions require **gas fees** denominated in ETH. These fluctuate based on network demand.  
- **Multi-Signature Wallets:** High-value transactions may benefit from wallets requiring multiple approvals.
