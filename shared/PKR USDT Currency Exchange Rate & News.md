# PKR/USDT Currency Exchange Rate & News

## Understanding the Pakistani Rupee (PKR)

The **Pakistani rupee** (PKR) serves as the official currency of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

This unique numbering system reflects the country's linguistic and cultural context, even as global numerical conventions become more prevalent. 

The rupee's stability is critical for Pakistan's economy, influenced by factors such as inflation, foreign exchange reserves, and geopolitical dynamics. Its performance against major currencies, including the **Tether (USDT)** stablecoin, is closely monitored by investors and policymakers.
