## Buda Exchange Security: Is It Legitimate?  

### Regulatory Compliance and Bank Partnerships  
Buda Exchange has established legitimacy through collaborations with traditional financial institutions. In 2023, Banco de BogotÃ¡ began facilitating transfers to and from Buda, marking a significant step toward mainstream acceptance. This partnership, while not part of a formal regulatory sandbox, aligns with Colombia's evolving crypto tax guidelines and anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks.

The exchange's cold storage strategy minimizes exposure to hacking risks. Unlike hot wallets connected to the internet, Buda's offline vaults create a formidable barrier against unauthorized access. Additionally, the platform employs encryption protocols for account information and key management.  

### Transparency and User Control  
Buda emphasizes user autonomy by ensuring:  
- **No Third-Party Access**: Only account holders can access encrypted assets.
